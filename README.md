- Searching items and members functionalities are added for extra points.
- In exam, assignment 1 and 2 are done completely. assignment 3 haven't done.

### Important Notes about Assignment:
1. If any item/member is selected from the table before clicking the "Edit" button, the program will open the "Add Item" form instead in both the Item and Member tabs of the application. Remember to always select an entry before attempting to edit it.
2. When I tried to move all the model classes to a Model file and all the Controllers classes to a Controller file, error occurred that's why I left all of them like that. It is confusing, I checked the packages etc. yet I couldn't find the solution to fix the error.
